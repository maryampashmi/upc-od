There is two important reason that why we choose these data source :
* technology point of view :
  * CERN: nice XML source, well structured, widespread Marc21 format
  * Harvard: API source, simple to understand (rather short documentation), much larger data set than CERN
  * British library: vast amount of data available
* similaryity point of view :
  since CERN & Harvard are both universities then both focused on scientific literature . Therefore we will expect large overlap between them .They are also perfect for testing our integration layer and deduplication.

*In the end we want to be able to add additional Sparqk and Marc21 sources by simply changing the configuration in our meta data repo.





We are interested in these data sources because they are complement each other . In one data source we extract some information that are not available in the other ones.

Harvard gave us complete information about like title, editor,isbn,publisher , publisher data  language, pages .These information are accessible by typing exact matching or keyword matching.
it give us also information about number of times the item has been checked out by undergraduates ,graduated student , ... of-courcse this information are not reliable bu they are exist .

In Cern data set , we have information commonly includes titles, names, subjects, notes and description of an item.More over it give us information about language,publication
